## Hi there 🕸️

The Goal here is to make working with plain wasm & wasi-preview1 easy & fun.

We try to keep things light & simple:

- low/zero dependency js that works in any runtime (bun/deno/etc)
- consider non-js hosts (wamr, wasmer, wasmedge, etc)
- consider languages other than C or rust for making wasm (zig, nim, assemblyscript, walt, codon, etc)
