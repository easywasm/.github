## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The Goal here is to make working with plain wasm & wasi-preview1 easy & fun.

We try to keep things light & simple:

- [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) over emscripten
- low/zero dependency js that works in any runtime
- consider non-js hosts
- consider languages other than C or rust for makign wasm
